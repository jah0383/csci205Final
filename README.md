## Project Information
Covid Clicker is a game based around the immune system of the human body. In this incremental 
game, you must try to generate as much DNA per second as possible. You do this by manually gaining DNA until you
can purchase a producer. The producer will automatically make DNA for you. Eventually, you can purchase different producers 
that help to increase you gained DNA per second. With your new-found wealth of DNA you can purchase more producers or 
upgrade the ones you already have. 

Our project uses JavaFX to display this game along with background music. The game's interface has different buttons that allow
the user to purchase producers, upgrade producers, generate their own DNA, as well as a see the current rate of production for each 
producer.

## Package Structure
Our files are contained within a main and test folder. Within our main folder, we have another main folder and a resrource folder. The second 
main folder contains all of our classes, and enums. Our resource folder contains the png files for our visual, our game's music and the JavaFX fxml file for our GUI.

In the test folder, we have our J-unit tests for the respective classes.
